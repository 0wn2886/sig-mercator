Information System (IS) mapping is an essential tool for mastering your information system (IS), and is mandatory for Operators of Vital Importance ([OIV](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9rateur_d%27importance_vitale)). Mapping your IS enables you to know all the elements that make it up, so as to gain a better understanding of it, and therefore better control over it. It forms part of an overall risk management approach.
